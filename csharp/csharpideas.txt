Simple way of transforming an Interface into endpoints: Similar to nhibernate.
- IMyInterface would construct controllers etc.

Automatically include top level method call into child method names without explicitly having a method parameter for it.
eg. DoSomeWorkWithFish() -> SendMethod -> log.Info("{method.Name}")
